# Angular-Project with Express.js REST API
 Project for my Angular final exam

1. The web application is a car listings application
2. Has the basic functionality of such applications
3. Implemented encrypted Authentication with a custom back-end(the REST API was provided by SoftUni but I configures it to the needs of my web project)
4. Has a lot of room for improvement but it had a deadline that had to be met
